# Toxic Comments Classification

Solution and exploration for the kaggle competetion

https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge

## Approach
We will try to plot various charactersitics of the text in order to derive some insights.

1. Examine the shape of the training data and plot countsfor each category
2. Figure out how many comments are not toxic at all
3. Generate word clouds per category
4. Create some direct features such as number of words, number of unique words, fraction of stopwords etc. These features will be created using the raw text
5. Next, we can create some derived features using `TfidfVectorizer`. We can create feature vectors for n-grams and not just words i.e. unigrams
6. Use `seaborn` to create boxplots and violin plots, wherever applicable to evaluate the effect of the features we have generated above
7. Use the above features to create a classifier

## Layout

### `hub`
This package has the `Driver.py` script which is the point of entry for the project.

### `feature_engineering`
This package has two scripts

#### `FeaturesFromContent.py` 
This script contains the classes needed for extracting features
- `Features`: This is the base class for extracting features
- `DirectFeatures`: This is a subclass of `Features` and is responsible for extracting direct features i.e. features that can be derived from raw text
- `DerivedFeatures`: This is also a subclass of `Features` and is responsible for creating feature vectors using `TfidfVectorizer`

#### `PlotFeatures.py` 
This script contains the classes needed for plotting features generated by any if the classes at `FeaturesFromContent.py`

- `Plotter`: This is the base class for plotting features
- `DirectFeaturesPlotter`: This is a subclass of `Plotter` and is responsible for plotting direct features i.e. features that were created by a `DirectFeatures` object
- `DerivedFeatures`: This is also a subclass of `Plotter` and is responsible for plotting derived features i.e. features that were created by a `DerivedFeatures` object

### `processor`
This package has the script `TextProcessors.py` which has all the methods needed for cleaning up the raw text
